  abstract = {Objective: Transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) sensors capture aspects of drinking events that self-reports cannot. The multidimensional nature of TAC data allows novel classification of drinking days and identification of associated behavioral and contextual risks. We used multilevel latent profile analysis (MLPA) to create day-level profiles of TAC features and test their associations with (a) daily behaviors and contexts and (b) risk for alcohol use disorders at baseline. Method: Two hundred twenty-two regularly heavy-drinking young adults (Mage = 22.3) completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at baseline and then responded to mobile phone surveys and wore TAC sensors for six consecutive days. MLPA identified day-level profiles using four TAC features (peak, rise rate, fall rate, and duration). TAC profiles were tested as correlates of daily drinking behaviors, contexts, and baseline AUDIT. Results: Four profiles emerged: (a) high-fast (8.5\% of days), (b) moderate-fast (12.8\%), (c) low-slow (20.4\%), and (d) little-to-no drinking days (58.2\%). Profiles differed in the odds of risky drinking behaviors and contexts. The highest risk occurred on high-fast days, followed by moderate-fast, low-slow, and little-to-no drinking days. Higher baseline AUDIT predicted higher odds of high-fast and moderate-fast days. Conclusions: Days with high and fast intoxication are reflective of high-risk drinking behaviors and were most frequent among those at risk for alcohol use disorders. TAC research using MLPA may offer novel and important insights to intervention efforts.},
