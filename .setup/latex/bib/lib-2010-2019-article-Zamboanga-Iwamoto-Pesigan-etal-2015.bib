  abstract = {Research with college students indicates that conformity to distinct masculine norms is associated with heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems. Drinking games (DGs) involve heavy alcohol consumption, and although such games have been characterized as a male-dominated activity, studies have not examined how gender-relevant factors such as conformity to masculine norms are associated with DGs participation. Moreover, the extent to which these associations vary as a function of race/ethnicity warrants further exploration because the exact role that these factors play in increasing college studentsâ€™ risk for DGs participation is unclear. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to examine the associations between distinct masculine norms and frequency of DGs participation (while controlling for typical alcohol consumption) in a sample of White ($n = 328$) and Asian American ($n = 136$) college men ($M_{\mathrm{age}} = 18.11$ years, SD = 0.35). A secondary aim was to test the degree to which such relationships are similar between these groups. Male college freshmen from a public university completed self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that increased levels of conformity to the masculine norms of being a playboy and heterosexual presentation were significantly associated with more frequent DGs participation for White but not Asian American college men. Implications for intervention and future research directions are discussed.},
